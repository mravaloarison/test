I'm a data analyst with a strong background in programming and software development. I love building software that feels like shortcuts, or smarter and more efficient approaches to problems, and I’m deeply curious about how data and new technologies can impact the world.

While I was a student, I activelly participated in hackathons, and won <a href="https://devpost.com/mrava">over 12 awards</a> across universities in the U.S. by building iOS and watchOS apps, web applications, desktop tools, and browser extensions. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills, collaboration, and ability to prototype ideas quickly.

Currently, I'm a data analyst at <a href="https://www.monroeu.edu/">Monroe University</a>, where I recreate legacy dashboards in Power BI. In addition to analytics work, I build and maintain SharePoint sites for my department and was recently assigned to redesign the university’s library website using SpringShare’s LibGuides platform.

This role has made me more serious about pursuing a career in data science and my plan to deepen my foundations through graduate study.

Outside of work, I love dogs, learning new songs on the piano, guitar, and bass, playing chess, and watching comedy and science fiction. I also try to consistently cook healthy meals and going to the gym, though I sometimes lack motivation to do so.
