I'm a data analyst with a strong background in programming and software development. I love building software that feels like shortcuts, or smarter and more efficient approaches to problems, and I’m deeply curious about how data and new technologies can impact the world.

While I was a student, I activelly participated in hackathons, and won <a href="https://devpost.com/mrava">over 12 awards</a> across universities in the U.S. by building iOS and watchOS apps, web applications, desktop tools, and browser extensions. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills, collaboration, and ability to prototype ideas quickly.

Currently, I'm a data analyst at my old school, where I recreate legacy dashboards in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi">Power BI</a>. In addition to analytics work, I build and maintain <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint">SharePoint</a> sites for my department and was recently assigned to redesign the university’s library website using <a href="https://www.springshare.com/">SpringShare</a>’s LibGuides platform.

This role has made me more serious about pursuing a career in data science and learn deeper foundations through graduate study.

Outside of work, I love dogs, learning new songs on the piano, guitar, and bass, playing chess, and video games. I also try to consistently cook healthy meals and going to the gym, though I’m still working on making those habits stick!
